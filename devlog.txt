OBSTACLES OVERCOME

coding split()
coding aces as 11's and then 1's when you bust
and making sure they reset every round
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
wow we so BOSS bc...

I actually find our casino pretty fun and if
it were  a game that had been available on
the school computers, I might be tempted to
play it. It's also pretty boss because blackjack
and slots run pretty seamlessly if you follow
the input you're supposed to.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
blah blah pesky bug...
maybe some of these will move into the Obs.Ovrcm section...
Aces messed up the game so much
Split was irritating at first but it was
because I missed a small error in some if
statements.

COOL STUFF LEARNED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
wow! oo!...

MID-DEVELOPMENT DESIGN CHANGES

Got rid of the blackjack ai idea because we
both had lots of other work and not enough
time to create a nice ai. I know they could
be simple and just lose but I felt the game
stand alone would be better than the game
with one relatively bad ai.
