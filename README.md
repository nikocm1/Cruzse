Final Project for APCS1, January 2017
Blackjack/Casino

The aim of our final project is to simulate a real life casino, in order to allow a user to enjoy typical casino games without the threat of losing real life money. Users can play 
either Blackjack or Texas Hold'em Poker against the computer, and (potentially) against their own friends.

Once you have compiled our program, you will be told the amount of cash you have asked to choose a game. Our program will store your name and record your cash as you progress and move in between our games. A knowledge of the basic rules of Blackjack and Texas Hold'em is all you will need in order to play the game.
